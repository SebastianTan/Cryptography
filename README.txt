Exercise 1:
(10^29) - Number of seconds to process 

In our best case scenario we have to process, sqrt(N) numbers. So (10^31)^(.5) = (10^15.5). We can perform 1 million of these calculations per second which is (10^15.5)/(10^6) = (10^9.5), which is about 3 billion seconds or 95 years. 

Exercise 2:

The number of primes less than (10^15.5) is lower bounded by x/ln(x) so (10^15.5)/ln(10^15.5) which is about 88.5 billion numbers. Using 64 bit unsigned encoding we would need 8 * 88.5 = 708 billion bytes of storage to implement this improvement. This is equivalent to about 2^39 in base two which is around a terabyte of storage.
